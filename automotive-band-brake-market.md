<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Band Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Simple Brake Band</li><li>Differential Brake Band</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive band brake market consists of two main types: simple brake band and differential brake band. A simple brake band is a type of brake band that applies uniform pressure around the entire circumference of the drum to slow down or stop the vehicle. On the other hand, a differential brake band is designed in a way that it applies different pressure on each side of the drum, which helps in achieving better control and stability during braking. Both types of brake bands are commonly used in automotive applications to ensure safe and efficient braking.</p></p>
