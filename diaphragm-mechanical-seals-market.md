<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diaphragm Mechanical Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pusher Type Seal</li><li>Non-pusher Seal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diaphragm mechanical seals are used in various industries to prevent leakage and enhance sealing efficiency. There are two main types of diaphragm mechanical seals in the market - pusher type seals and non-pusher seals. Pusher type seals use springs or bellows to apply pressure on the seal faces, ensuring proper contact and compensation for wear. On the other hand, non-pusher seals rely on the pressure of the process fluid to maintain contact between the seal faces. Both types have their advantages depending on the specific application requirements.</p></p>
