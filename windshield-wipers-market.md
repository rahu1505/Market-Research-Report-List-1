<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Windshield Wipers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bone wiper</li><li>Boneless wiper</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The windshield wipers market can be divided into two main types: bone wipers and boneless wipers. Bone wipers feature a metal framework or "skeleton" that holds the rubber blade in place. The metal framework provides stability and support to the wiper blade. On the other hand, boneless wipers do not have a metal framework and instead rely on a flexible spine or hinge for support. This design allows for greater flexibility and adaptability to various windshield shapes, resulting in better performance and reduced noise.</p></p>
