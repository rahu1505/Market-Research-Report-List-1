This is primarily due to the numerous advantages offered by self-ligating brackets over traditional brackets. These advantages include faster treatment times, improved oral hygiene, reduced discomfort, and increased patient satisfaction.</p><p>In addition, the growing prevalence of orthodontic conditions such as malocclusion and the rise in aesthetic dental treatments are driving the demand for self-ligating brackets. Furthermore, technological advancements in self-ligating bracket systems, such as the development of passive self-ligating brackets that require even fewer adjustments, are expected to fuel market growth.</p><p>The increasing adoption of self-ligating brackets by orthodontists worldwide is also contributing to the market's growth. These brackets are becoming the preferred choice due to their superior performance and better treatment outcomes.</p><p>Overall, the self-ligating bracket market has a positive outlook, with a lucrative future ahead. Technological advancements, increasing awareness about dental aesthetics, and the advantages offered by self-ligating brackets are expected to drive the market's growth in the coming years.</p></p>
