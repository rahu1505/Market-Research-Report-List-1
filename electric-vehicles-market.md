<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BEV</li><li>PHEV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric Vehicles (EV) are classified into two main categories: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). BEVs rely solely on electric power, with a rechargeable battery powering an electric motor. This type of EV has no internal combustion engine and produces zero emissions while driving. PHEVs, on the other hand, combine an electric motor with an internal combustion engine. They can be recharged from an external power source but also have the flexibility of utilizing gasoline or diesel, acting as a backup power source if needed.</p></p>
