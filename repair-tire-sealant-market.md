<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Repair tire sealant is a product designed to seal punctures in tires and prevent air leakage. It is available in two main types: gel and aerosol. Gel sealants are thick liquids that can be applied directly to the puncture, forming a protective layer. They are more commonly used for larger, slow leaks.
