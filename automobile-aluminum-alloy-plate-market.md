<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile Aluminum Alloy Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Rolling</li><li>Hot Rolling</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automobile aluminum alloy plates are used in the automotive industry for their lightweight and high strength properties. Cold rolling and hot rolling are the two main types of processes involved in manufacturing these plates. Cold rolling involves passing the aluminum through rollers at room temperature, resulting in a smoother surface finish and improved mechanical properties. Hot rolling, on the other hand, involves heating the aluminum and then passing it through rollers, which increases its flexibility and reduces brittleness. Both processes play a crucial role in producing high-quality aluminum alloy plates for automobile applications.</p></p>
