<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mercury Cadmium Telluride Infrared Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cooled</li><li>Uncooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT) Infrared Detector market consists of two main types: cooled and uncooled detectors. Cooled detectors require the use of a cooling mechanism, typically a cryogenic cooler, to cool down the detector's temperature, allowing for higher sensitivity and better performance in imaging applications. On the other hand, uncooled detectors do not require any external cooling, making them more convenient and cost-effective but sacrificing some performance capabilities compared to cooled detectors. Both types have their own advantages and are suitable for different applications depending on the desired performance level and budget.</p></p>
