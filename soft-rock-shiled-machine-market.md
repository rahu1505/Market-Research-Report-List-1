<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soft-Rock Shiled Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Slurry Shield (SS)</li><li>Earth Pressure Balance Machines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Soft-rock shield machines are used in tunneling projects to excavate tunnels through soft rock formations. There are two main types of soft-rock shield machines: Slurry Shield (SS) and Earth Pressure Balance (EPB) machines. Slurry Shield machines utilize a combination of bentonite slurry and cutting tools to excavate the soft rock while maintaining stability. On the other hand, Earth Pressure Balance machines use the excavated material to create a balanced earth pressure within the tunnel, preventing collapses. Both machines are effective in tunneling through soft-rock formations but employ different mechanisms to achieve stability.</p></p>
