<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Food Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Type</li><li>Discontinuous Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>In the infrared food dryer market, there are two types of markets: continuous type and discontinuous type. </p><p>Continuous type infrared food dryers are designed to process food products continuously without interruption. They have a continuous conveyor belt system that moves the food through the drying chamber, allowing for a consistent and efficient drying process. These types of dryers are commonly used in large-scale food production facilities.</p><p>Discontinuous type infrared food dryers, on the other hand, are designed for smaller-scale operations. They require manual loading and unloading of food products into the drying chamber, which is then sealed for the drying process. This type of dryer is suitable for smaller food processing businesses or those that require batch processing.</p><p>Both types of infrared food dryers offer efficient and effective drying solutions, but their suitability and cost-effectiveness depend on the scale and needs of the food processing operation.</p></p>
