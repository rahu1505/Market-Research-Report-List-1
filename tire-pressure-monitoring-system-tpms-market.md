<p><strong>The Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is a technology used in vehicles to monitor the air pressure inside tires and alert drivers about any significant deviations. Direct TPMS works through sensors installed in each tire, providing real-time pressure readings. On the other hand, Indirect TPMS calculates tire pressure using data from the vehicle's anti-lock braking system. Direct TPMS provides more accurate and reliable information, while Indirect TPMS is a less expensive option that estimates tire pressure indirectly. Both types serve the purpose of ensuring safe driving conditions and avoiding tire-related accidents.</p></p>
