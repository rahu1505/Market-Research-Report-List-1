<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake Caliper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Piston Caliper</li><li>Multi-Piston Caliper</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive brake caliper market can be categorized into two types: single piston caliper and multi-piston caliper. A single piston caliper consists of only one piston that applies pressure on the brake pads to stop the vehicle. On the other hand, a multi-piston caliper has multiple pistons that distribute the pressure more evenly, resulting in improved braking performance and reduced brake fade. The choice between these two types depends on the specific requirements and preferences of the vehicle manufacturer and consumer.</p></p>
