<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sedan and Hatchback Wheel Speed Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hall Type</li><li>Magnetic Electric Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Sedan and Hatchback Wheel Speed Sensor market consists of two major types: Hall Type and Magnetic Electric Type. Hall Type wheel speed sensors are based on the Hall Effect, which detects changes in magnetic fields when the wheel rotates. These sensors use magnets and generate electrical signals accordingly. On the other hand, Magnetic Electric Type sensors utilize a magnetic field and measure the changes in the magnetic resistance when the wheel spins. Both sensor types serve the purpose of measuring wheel speed accurately in Sedan and Hatchback vehicles.</p></p>
