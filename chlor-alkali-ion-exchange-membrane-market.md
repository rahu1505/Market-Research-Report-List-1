<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chlor-alkali Ion Exchange Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Membrane with Sacrificial Thread</li><li>Membrane without Sacrificial Thread</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Chlor-alkali Ion Exchange Membrane Market includes two types: Membrane with Sacrificial Thread and Membrane without Sacrificial Thread. Membrane with Sacrificial Thread consists of a protective layer that degrades over time, preserving the integrity of the membrane and extending its lifespan. On the other hand, Membrane without Sacrificial Thread does not have this protective layer and may require frequent replacement. Both types serve the purpose of separating positive and negative ions during the electrolysis process, but the presence or absence of the sacrificial thread differentiates their durability and maintenance needs.</p></p>
