<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VAE Emulsion Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Waterproof VAE Emulsions</li><li>Ordinary VAE Emulsions</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>VAE (vinyl acetate ethylene) emulsion is a type of adhesive used in various industries. The market for VAE emulsions can be classified into two types: waterproof VAE emulsions and ordinary VAE emulsions. Waterproof VAE emulsions are specifically designed to provide enhanced water resistance properties, making them ideal for applications where moisture protection is essential, such as in the construction industry. On the other hand, ordinary VAE emulsions do not possess the same level of water resistance and are typically used in less demanding applications, like paper, textiles, and non-woven fabrics manufacturing.</p></p>
