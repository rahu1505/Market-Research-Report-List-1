<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Frequency Electrosurgical Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar Circuit</li><li>Bipolar Circuit</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The High Frequency Electrosurgical Generator Market is categorized into two main types: Monopolar Circuit and Bipolar Circuit. In a monopolar circuit, the electrosurgical energy flows from the generator through the active electrode, into the patient's body, and back to the generator through a dispersive electrode. This type is commonly used for general surgical procedures. On the other hand, in a bipolar circuit, both the active and dispersive electrodes are located within the surgical instrument, allowing for precise control of energy during delicate procedures, such as neurosurgery or ophthalmology.</p></p>
