<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio Nematicides Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Bio Nematicides</li><li>Dry Bio Nematicides</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Bio nematicides are natural alternatives to chemical nematicides that are used to control nematode infestations in crops. There are two main types of bio nematicides: liquid and dry. Liquid bio nematicides are solutions or suspensions of natural substances that can be easily sprayed onto crops. They are convenient to use and provide effective control against nematodes. On the other hand, dry bio nematicides are powders or granules made from natural materials. They are typically applied to the soil before planting and slowly release their active ingredients, providing long-term protection against nematodes.</p></p>
