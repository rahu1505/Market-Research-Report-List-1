<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Noise Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier</li><li>Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier segment of the concrete noise barrier market refers to barriers that are installed on the ground level, typically alongside highways or railways, to reduce noise pollution. They are designed to absorb or block the sound waves and reflect the noise away from the surrounding area. On the other hand, Structure-Mounted Noise Barriers are barriers that are attached to existing structures such as walls or buildings to mitigate noise. They are commonly used in urban areas where space is limited and constructively integrate with the existing infrastructure.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Concrete Noise Barrier Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier</li><li>Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The concrete noise barrier market includes two main applications: ground-mounted and structure-mounted noise barriers. Ground-mounted noise barriers are installed directly on the ground, usually alongside highways or railways, to reduce noise pollution. They are commonly used in urban areas to protect residents from excessive noise. On the other hand, structure-mounted noise barriers are attached to existing structures, such as buildings or bridges, to block noise from passing through. These barriers are often used in areas where ground-mounted barriers are not feasible or sufficient.</p></p>
