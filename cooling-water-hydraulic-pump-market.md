<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cooling Water Hydraulic Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piston</li><li>Positive-Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Cooling Water Hydraulic Pump market offers different types of pumps, namely Piston and Positive-Displacement pumps. A Piston pump operates by the reciprocating action of a piston within a cylinder, generating pressure as liquid is forced through the system. On the other hand, Positive-Displacement pumps function by using a rotating mechanism to push fluid into a sealed cavity, trapping and forcing it out under pressure. Both types of pumps play crucial roles in ensuring effective circulation and cooling of water in hydraulic systems, offering varying benefits depending on the specific application requirements.</p></p>
