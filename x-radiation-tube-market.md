<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-Radiation Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Anode</li><li>Rotating Anode</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The X-Radiation Tube market consists of two primary types: stationary anode and rotating anode. In a stationary anode tube, the anode remains fixed, allowing for consistent heat dissipation and simple construction, making it suitable for low-power applications. On the other hand, rotating anode tubes have a rotating anode that provides enhanced heat dissipation capabilities, making them ideal for high-power applications where continuous radiation generation is required. Rotating anode tubes are more complex and expensive but offer higher performance and durability than their stationary anode counterparts.</p></p>
