<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermoelectric Cooling Modules Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage</li><li>Multi Stage</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Thermoelectric Cooling Modules are devices that use the Peltier effect to transfer heat from one side of the module to the other, providing cooling. There are two main types: Single Stage and Multi Stage. Single Stage modules have a single layer of thermoelectric material, and they can achieve a temperature difference of up to 70°C. Multi Stage modules have multiple layers, allowing for larger temperature differences, up to 130°C. The choice between these types depends on the specific cooling requirements of the application, with single stage modules being suitable for most cooling needs and multi stage modules ideal for more demanding cooling applications.</p></p>
