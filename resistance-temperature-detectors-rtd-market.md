<p><strong>The Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTD) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-wire Configuration</li><li>Three-wire Configuration</li><li>Four-wire Configuration</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs) are devices used to measure temperature by correlating the resistance of an electrical conductor with changes in temperature. RTD market includes three main types - Two-wire Configuration, Three-wire Configuration, and Four-wire Configuration. In the Two-wire Configuration, the RTD is connected in series with the power source, resulting in inaccurate readings due to resistance in the wiring. Three-wire Configuration eliminates the wire resistance issue by using an additional wire to compensate for it. Four-wire Configuration provides the most accurate temperature measurements by separating the current and voltage measurement circuits, ensuring no interference from the wire resistance.</p></p>
