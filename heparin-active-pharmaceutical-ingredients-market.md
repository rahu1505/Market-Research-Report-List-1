<p><strong>The Heparin Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>UFH</li><li>LMWH</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Heparin active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) market is primarily driven by the use of Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) and Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH) in various applications. UFH, a highly effective anticoagulant, finds application in acute medical conditions like deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. On the other hand, LMWH, being more convenient and safer, is extensively used in preventing and treating blood clotting diseases such as venous thromboembolism and myocardial infarction. Both UFH and LMWH play crucial roles in the pharmaceutical industry and are in high demand due to their therapeutic benefits.</p></p>
