<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyisobutene-Based Pressure-Sensitive Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Waterborne</li><li>Solvent Borne</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Polyisobutene-based pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are categorized into two major market types: waterborne and solvent borne. Waterborne PSAs are formulated using water as the dispersing medium and offer benefits such as low VOC emissions, easy clean-up, and environmental friendliness. Solvent-borne PSAs, on the other hand, use organic solvents as the dispersing medium. They provide excellent adhesion, quick tack, and more resistance to high temperatures. While waterborne PSAs are favored for their eco-friendly attributes, solvent-borne PSAs are preferred for their superior performance properties in specific applications.</p></p>
