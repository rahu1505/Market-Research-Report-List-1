<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Decking & Railing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capped Composites</li><li>Uncapped Composites</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Composite decking and railing market can be categorized into two types: capped composites and uncapped composites. Capped composites are deck boards constructed with a protective layer on top, providing enhanced durability and resistance to fading, staining, and mold growth. They offer a low-maintenance solution with a longer lifespan. On the other hand, uncapped composites lack this protective layer and are generally more affordable. While they still offer some level of durability and ease of maintenance, they may require more frequent cleaning and may be more prone to color fading and staining over time.</p></p>
