<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bicycle Gearbox Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multiple Gear</li><li>Fixed Gear</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The bicycle gearbox market consists of two main types: multiple gear and fixed gear. Multiple gear systems allow riders to switch between various gear ratios, enabling them to easily adapt to different terrains and riding conditions. This type is preferred by most enthusiasts, as it offers versatility and efficient pedaling. In contrast, fixed gear systems have a single gear ratio, meaning the rider cannot coast or change gears. These gearboxes are typically favored by urban riders who prefer a simple and low-maintenance biking experience.</p></p>
