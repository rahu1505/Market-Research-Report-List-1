<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Airless Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tires</li><li>Bias Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive airless tire market consists of two main types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires are constructed with layers of fabric cords that run radially from the tire's center to the bead area, providing better flexibility and heat dissipation. On the other hand, bias tires have fabric cords that crisscross diagonally, providing a stiffer sidewall and better load-carrying capacity. Both types have their advantages and disadvantages, and their usage depends on the specific requirements and preferences of customers in terms of performance, cost, and application.</p></p>
