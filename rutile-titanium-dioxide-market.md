<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rutile Titanium Dioxide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulfate Process</li><li>Chloride Process</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Rutile Titanium Dioxide Market Types include the Sulfate Process and the Chloride Process. The Sulfate Process involves the conversion of ilmenite ore into titanium dioxide through a chemical reaction with sulfuric acid. This method is most widely used due to its lower cost and environmental friendliness. On the other hand, the Chloride Process involves the use of chlorine to convert titanium ore into titanium tetrachloride, which is then processed further to obtain titanium dioxide. This method is more expensive but yields a higher quality product with fewer impurities.</p></p>
