<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The luminous Pigment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Luminous Coatings</li><li>Fluorescent Coatings</li><li>Phosphorescent Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The luminous pigment market includes various types of coatings, such as self-luminous, fluorescent, and phosphorescent coatings. Self-luminous coatings contain pigment particles that emit light without requiring an external source of light. Fluorescent coatings absorb ultraviolet light and emit visible light, resulting in vibrant colors. Phosphorescent coatings store light energy and slowly release it over time, allowing them to glow in the dark. These coatings find applications in industries like automotive, construction, and aerospace for safety signage, decorative purposes, and visibility enhancement in low-light conditions.</p></p>
