<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerospace and Defense Carbon Brakes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Vapor Infiltration</li><li>Liquid Phase Infiltration</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Aerospace and Defense Carbon Brakes market can be classified into two types - Chemical Vapor Infiltration (CVI) and Liquid Phase Infiltration (LPI). CVI involves the introduction of precursor gases into a high-temperature environment, where the carbon material is deposited on the brake substrate. This method ensures high-quality and uniform brake properties. On the other hand, LPI utilizes a liquid precursor that infiltrates the porous material and transforms it into a solid carbon matrix. LPI offers better control over the infiltration process, resulting in improved brake performance.</p></p>
